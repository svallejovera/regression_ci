- 3 Introduction to Causal Inference ([link](https://github.com/svallejovera/regression_ci/blob/main/slide/2%20What%20is%20Causal%20Inference.pptx)) 

## Introduction

We now dive deeper into causal inference and the counterfactual problem. We show why randomized trails solve that counterfactual problem, but why this is not the case with observational data. No fancy code for this week.
