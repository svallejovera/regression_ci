&nbsp;

Welcome to the site for the course PS9591: "Regressions and Causal Inference" at Western University, taught by Sebastián Vallejo Vera. In each week, you will find the code, exercises, and slides for the corresponding topic. 

Before you start, check the required software and packages below. Also, don't forget to read the [Syllabus](https://github.com/svallejovera/regression_ci/blob/main/files/9591B_Regression_and_Causal_Inference_2025.pdf) and check Perusall for the readings for the course. This site will be corrected/updated throughout the semester(s).

## Software and Packages

For this course, we will be using R. I will assume that you are minimally familiar with R language, RStudio, and R packages. However, the course includes labs on coding in R. These are the main packages you will need to have installed:

- tidyverse (you will be pipin')
- tidylog (helps keep track of what your are pipin')

## Datasets

Throughout the class, we will be using a number of sample datasets. Access to these datasets will be provided directly on the code. For the class For your Final Exam, I will post the required datasets for the replication exercise here:

## Final Exam

The final exam will require students to replicate the findings from a some papers, and interpret the results. 

## Acknowledgments 

The organization of this course is based on the great textbook 'The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality' by Nick Huntington-Klein, freely available at [here](https://theeffectbook.net/). The code used throughout for the main lectures is a patchwork of my own code, but my own code borrows heavily from the internet (but that's true for all code). I try my best to give credit to the original authors of the code (when and if possible). The code for the labs was created and revised by two amazing doctoral students[^1] at Western University, Hugo Machado and John Santos (and are posted here with their permission).
